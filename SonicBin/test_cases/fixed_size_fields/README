| THE FIXED-SIZE FIELDS (.fsf) FILE FORMAT |
+------------------------------------------+
Every file in the FSF format has size exactly 32 bytes:

    - The first byte is the length of the payload.
    - The next 30 bytes contain the payload.
    - The final byte is the decryption key: every byte in the payload should
      have this value subtracted to get the original ASCII text.
